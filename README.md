ida-style listing, a decompiler, a function graph, an x64dbg-style debugger, lua plugins, and a built-in MCP server so you can point an AI at a binary — one small program, everything vendored, nothing to install to build.

![listing](docs/listing.png)

## one function, three ways

ceasta shows the same code from raw bytes up to readable c, so you can drop to whatever level you need:

```text
; assembly - the real instructions  // pseudocode (f5) - reconstructed c

checksum proc                       int checksum(int rdi)
  movzx   edx, byte ptr [rdi]       {
  test    dl, dl                        rdx = *(char*)rdi;
  je      loc_1191                      if (rdx == 0) {
  mov     eax, 0x1505                       return 0x1505;
loc_1179:                               }
  mov     ecx, eax                      rax = 0x1505;
  shl     ecx, 5                        do {
  add     eax, ecx                          rax = rax + (rax << 5) + rdx;
  add     rdi, 1                            rdi = rdi + 1;
  movzx   edx, dl                           rdx = *(char*)rdi;
  add     eax, edx                      } while (rdx != 0);
  movzx   edx, byte ptr [rdi]           return rax;
  test    dl, dl                    }
  jne     loc_1179
  ret
loc_1191:
  mov     eax, 0x1505
  ret
```

that's djb2 (5381 is `0x1505`, and `(h << 5) + h` is `h * 33`). click a name in the pseudocode and name things as you understand them — `y` on the function gives it a prototype, `n` renames a variable:

```c
unsigned checksum(const char* s)
{
    rdx = *(char*)s;
    if (rdx == 0) {
        return 0x1505;
    }
    h = 0x1505;
    do {
        h = h + (h << 5) + rdx;
        s = s + 1;
        rdx = *(char*)s;
    } while (rdx != 0);
    return h;
}
```

the decompiler is best-effort (x86 / x64, no structs yet) — great for getting a routine quickly, while the listing stays the source of truth.

## what it does

- opens pe files (exe, dll, sys — x86, x64 and arm64), elf (x86, x64, arm64, and mips32 including kernel modules), mach-o (macos / ios programs and libraries, x86_64 and arm64, universal files too) and raw code
- mips32, little endian (ingenic xburst — the t-series camera SoCs, and anything else mips32r2): full decode including ingenic's mxu simd extension, kernel modules with relocations applied (`.ko` — hi16/lo16 pairs and friends, so cross section references resolve), got imports and plt thunks named, o32 call arguments in the listing, ingenic IMP / ISP prototypes built in, and pseudocode via kuna. see [mips and camera firmware](#mips-and-camera-firmware)
- auto analysis: functions (entry, exports, symbols, .pdata, unwind tables, mach-o function starts, tls callbacks, calls, pointers in data), switch tables, xrefs, strings (ascii + utf-16), imports / exports, thunks, noreturn calls
- ida-style listing: names instead of addresses, labels, xref and string comments, the arguments each instruction passes to a known api
- function graph (space): colored edges, zoom with ctrl + wheel, drag to pan
- decompiler (f5, x86 / x64): c-like pseudocode — if / else, loops, switch, stack variables, calls with their arguments (~350 known api prototypes). click a name: `n` renames it, `y` sets a type or a prototype. shift+f5 shows it next to the listing
- a second decompiler if you want one: with [kuna](https://github.com/Noelo-Lab/kuna) installed (a decompiler ported from ghidra's), the pseudocode view gets a `kuna` switch — its output for the same function, lines linked to the listing, arm64 and mips too, speaking the names and prototypes from your listing. [more below](#second-decompiler-kuna)
- file info: headers, security flags (aslr, dep, cfg / pie, nx, relro, canary / hardened runtime), md5 / sha256 / imphash, section entropy, resources, version info, a mac program's code signature and entitlements, and warnings when it looks packed
- search everything (ctrl+f): functions, names, imports, exports, strings, comments and segments in one box, and the strings say where they're used
- debugger (x86 / x64 native on windows and linux, arm64 / mips through the linux backend — mips runs under `qemu-mipsel` with `CEASTA_ROOTFS` set to the extracted firmware root): start or attach, breakpoints (with conditions: `rdi == 3`), watchpoints on variables (native backends), step into / over / out, step back, run to cursor, pause, registers, stack, call stack, memory map, live memory
  - the pseudocode marks the line you're stopped on
  - call a function in the running program (`call decrypt "..."`), record indirect call targets as xrefs (`trace`)
  - `ceasta-cli dbg`: the same debugger in a terminal
- binary diff: match functions between two builds and see what changed
- library signatures: name known functions in a stripped binary (`sigmake` / `sigapply`)
- a built-in MCP server: connect an AI (Claude Code, Cursor, ...) to the open binary from the AI menu, or with `ceasta-cli mcp` — with ready-made prompts, and names you review before they're applied. with `ceasta-cli mcp` the AI can open and close files itself and walk a whole firmware image — kernel modules, apps, raw dumps — in one session. see [connect an AI](docs/mcp.md)
- rename, comments, bookmarks, jump to address or name, xrefs, byte search, back / forward, undo / redo, and every action in one list (ctrl+shift+p)
- your work in one file, like ida's `.i64`: ctrl+s writes `<file>.ceasta` with your names, comments, types, breakpoints and the program itself — it opens later, or on another machine, without the original. closing asks before it throws unsaved work away
- trade names with other tools: export an idapython script, a ghidra script or an x64dbg database; import from x64dbg, `.map` files, and ida / ghidra (with the scripts in `scripts/`)
- lua plugins and a lua console; `ceasta-cli` for scripts and ci

## layout

one window, nothing floating around:

- top: menu and toolbar
- left: functions
- middle: overview band, then the listing, the graph, the pseudocode, or listing and pseudocode side by side
- right: imports / exports / strings / file info / xrefs, with the debugger (registers + stack) under it while debugging
- bottom: output + lua console, hex, breakpoints — and call stack and memory while debugging
- drag the lines between panels to resize, the view menu hides panels and switches theme, ctrl + / ctrl - changes the text size

## keys

| key | what | key | what |
|-----|------|-----|------|
| ctrl+o | open a file (or a `.ceasta`) | space | listing / graph |
| g | jump to address or name | f5 / shift+f5 | pseudocode / next to the listing |
| ctrl+f | search names, imports, strings, ... | alt+b | search bytes |
| enter / double click | follow the operand | f9 | start debugging / continue |
| esc / ctrl+enter | back / forward | f7 / f8 | step into / over (n at once: the box by the step buttons) |
| n | rename (in the pseudocode too) | ctrl+f9 / shift+f7 | step out / step back |
| y | type / prototype (pseudocode) | f4 | run to cursor |
| ; | comment | f2 | breakpoint (on data: watch it) |
| x | references to here | shift+f2 | breakpoint condition |
| alt+m / ctrl+m | bookmark / bookmarks | f12 | pause |
| ctrl+z / ctrl+y | undo / redo | ctrl+s | save |
| ctrl+shift+p | every action | f1 | all shortcuts |

## plugins

plugins are lua files in `plugins/` (next to the program) or in your own plugins folder (`%APPDATA%\ceasta\plugins`, `~/.config/ceasta/plugins`). they add commands to the plugins menu. five come with it: file summary, crypto finder, wrapper namer, strings report, call tracer (debugger).

```lua
ceasta.register_command("Count calls", function()
    local n = 0
    for _, fn in ipairs(ceasta.functions()) do
        n = n + #ceasta.xrefs_to(fn.addr)
    end
    ceasta.log(n .. " references to functions")
end)
```

the whole api is in the [lua scripting guide](docs/lua.md). the output panel has a lua prompt too — try `ceasta.name(ceasta.here())`.

## cli

```
ceasta-cli info file.exe            headers, security flags, hashes, sections, warnings
ceasta-cli funcs file.exe           functions
ceasta-cli disasm file.exe main 40  listing from a name or address
ceasta-cli graph file.exe start     basic blocks of a function
ceasta-cli decompile file.exe main  pseudocode for a function (--kuna: kuna's)
ceasta-cli xrefs file.exe CreateFileW
ceasta-cli find file.exe "48 8b ?? 05"
ceasta-cli search file.exe usage    find text in names, imports, strings, comments
ceasta-cli run file.exe script.lua  run a plugin / script
ceasta-cli dbg ./program [args]     interactive debugger (linux + windows)
ceasta-cli diff old.exe new.exe     match functions, show what changed
ceasta-cli sigmake libc.a lib.sig   make signatures from a file with symbols
ceasta-cli sigapply stripped lib.sig  name matching functions
ceasta-cli export file.exe --ida out.py   your names for ida (--ghidra, --x64dbg too)
ceasta-cli import file.exe names.json     names from x64dbg, a .map, ida or ghidra
ceasta-cli mcp file.exe             serve the file to an AI over MCP
```

`--raw32` / `--raw64` / `--raw-arm64` / `--raw-mips` (and `--base <hex>`) load a file as raw code.

## second decompiler: kuna

[kuna](https://github.com/Noelo-Lab/kuna) is a decompiler ported from ghidra's (apache-2.0). ceasta doesn't ship it — it runs kuna's command line tool when you have it:

- install kuna the way its readme says and put `kuna` on your PATH, or point ceasta at it: view > second decompiler (kuna)...
- the pseudocode view then has a `ceasta | kuna` switch. kuna's output is read-only and uses its own names (`sub_401000`, `dat_404010`), but its lines are linked to the listing like ceasta's, and a click on `sub_...` jumps there
- it reads arm64 too, where ceasta's own decompiler stops
- `ceasta-cli decompile file main --kuna` (or `--kuna-path /path/to/kuna`), and the AI gets a `decompile_with_kuna` tool

## connect an AI

point an AI (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, ...) at the binary through ceasta's built-in
MCP server. in the app: **AI > Connect an AI...**, start the server, and paste the command it
shows into your client:

```
claude mcp add --transport http ceasta http://127.0.0.1:8744/mcp
```

the AI then works on what you have open — its renames and comments appear as it goes, and with
the debugger allowed you watch it set breakpoints and step. without the app:

```
claude mcp add ceasta -- ceasta-cli mcp /path/to/target.exe
```

it can decompile, read xrefs, rename functions and variables, set prototypes, diff builds, and —
with the debugger allowed (`--allow-debug`) — set breakpoints and watchpoints, step (and step
back), read memory and even call a function in the running program. ready-made prompts
(`triage`, `explain_function`, `rename_pass`, `find_crypto`, `trace_function`) show up as
commands in the client, and the names it suggests wait for you in **AI > Review suggested
names**. the full guide, including the debugger tools and the safety notes, is in
[connect an AI](docs/mcp.md).

## on linux

the full app is an AppImage: download `ceasta-x.y.z-linux-x64.AppImage`, make it executable and run it — nothing to install (ubuntu 22.04 or newer, or a distro of the same age). it needs an x11 or wayland desktop with opengl 3; file dialogs use zenity or kdialog when they're there, and you can always drop a file on the window.

```
chmod +x ceasta-*-linux-x64.AppImage
./ceasta-*-linux-x64.AppImage /bin/ls
```

if it complains about fuse, run it with `--appimage-extract-and-run`. the debugger is the same one as on windows (ptrace underneath); `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` may need to be 0 to attach to a running process.

for servers and scripts there's the command line tool, `ceasta-cli-x.y.z-linux-x64.tar.gz`: the analysis, disassembly, decompiler, scripting, a terminal debugger, binary diff, signatures and the mcp server. unpack and run:

```
tar xzf ceasta-cli-*-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd ceasta-cli-*-linux-x64

./ceasta-cli info /bin/ls                   headers, hashes, sections, warnings
./ceasta-cli decompile /bin/ls start        pseudocode for the entry point
./ceasta-cli run /bin/ls plugins/hello.lua  run a lua plugin
./ceasta-cli dbg ./program                  debug it (break, step, registers, memory)
```

both read elf, windows pe and mac mach-o files alike (x86, x64, arm64, mips), so you can look at a windows exe — or an arm64 phone or server binary, a mac app, or a camera firmware — from linux too.

the terminal debugger (`dbg`) is a ptrace debugger with ceasta's names, disassembly and decompiler built in:

```
(ceasta) b main            break at a name or address
(ceasta) c                 continue
(ceasta) ni / si           step over / into      until <addr>  run to
(ceasta) r                 registers             k  stack       x <addr>  memory
(ceasta) u                 disassemble here (with names)
(ceasta) dec               decompile the function you're stopped in
(ceasta) bt / maps         call stack / memory map
(ceasta) watch <addr>      stop when it's written (awatch: read or written)
(ceasta) back / finish     step back / step out
(ceasta) lua ...           run lua against the live process
```

## on a mac

the app comes as `ceasta-x.y.z-macos.dmg`: open it and drag ceasta to Applications. one app runs on apple silicon and intel macs (macos 11 or newer). it's signed ad-hoc but not notarized by apple, so the first time macos stops it — right-click ceasta.app > **Open** (on macos 15 and later: System Settings > Privacy & Security > **Open Anyway**), or once in a terminal:

```
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ceasta.app
```

the shortcuts use cmd where the others use ctrl (cmd+s, cmd+z, cmd+shift+p, ...). plugins you add go in `~/Library/Application Support/ceasta/plugins`.

it reads mach-o files: programs, libraries, bundles and `.o` files, x86_64 and arm64 (arm64e too, apple's own). names show without the underscore mach-o puts in front (`main`, `printf`), like on the other systems. a universal file opens its x86_64 part (the decompiler reads it) and the arm64 part is one cmd+shift+p away ("part"), or `--arch arm64` on the command line. the file tab shows what a mac program says about itself: the minimum macos and sdk, the libraries and rpaths, the code signature (who signed it, hardened runtime, library validation) and its entitlements, with a warning for the ones that let code in (`get-task-allow`, `disable-library-validation`, dyld environment variables, jit). to read an app, open the program inside it: the open panel goes into `.app` bundles (Contents/MacOS/...).

```
./ceasta-cli info /bin/ls                        universal, arm64e, signed by apple
./ceasta-cli funcs /bin/ls --arch arm64          the arm64 part
./ceasta-cli decompile /Applications/Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo main
```

there's no debugger on macos yet: that needs apple's debugging interfaces and a signed, entitled build. the windows and linux builds have one, and they read mac files too.

## mips and camera firmware

mips32, little endian — ingenic's xburst cores (the t10–t41 camera SoCs and friends), and any other mips32r2-class code:

- decode: the full base isa plus ingenic's own mxu simd extension (capstone stops at plain mips, so ceasta decodes it itself)
- formats: elf (u-boot, vmlinux, apps, stripped or not), kernel modules (`.ko` — relocations are applied at load, so `hi16` / `lo16` pairs and cross section references resolve), and flat dumps (`--raw-mips --base <hex>`, or "mips" in the open-as-raw panel)
- analysis: `lui` / `addiu` constant pairs tracked like arm64's adrp/add, got imports and plt thunks named (`j_strcpy`), switch tables resolved, and o32 call arguments in the listing (`a0`–`a3`, stack and delay slots)
- ingenic IMP / ISP prototypes are built in, so camera firmware calls come out with named, typed arguments
- pseudocode via kuna, speaking the names from your listing
- debug under emulation: install qemu-user, point `CEASTA_ROOTFS` at an extracted firmware root, and the debugger runs the program — breakpoints, stepping, registers, memory. watchpoints and `call` stay native-only

```
ceasta-cli info firmware.bin                      a whole flash dump, raw
ceasta-cli funcs rootfs/usr/lib/modules/audio.ko  a kernel module, relocations applied
ceasta-cli decompile rootfs/usr/bin/prudynt 0x17a80 --kuna
ceasta-cli dbg rootfs/usr/bin/prudynt             live, under qemu-mipsel
```

## build

everything needed is in the repo — just a compiler, nothing to fetch.

**windows**
- visual studio 2022: open `ceasta.sln`, pick `Release | x64`, build → `build\msvc\Release`
- or cmake: `cmake -S . -B build` then `cmake --build build --config Release`
- release files (zip + installer, needs [inno setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)): `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File installer\package.ps1`

**linux** (core + cli)
```
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j
```

**linux gui** (needs `libglfw3-dev` and an opengl dev package; ci packs it into the AppImage with linuxdeploy, see `.github/workflows/build.yml`)
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCEASTA_LINUX_GUI=ON && cmake --build build -j
```

**macos** (the app needs glfw: `brew install glfw`; without it only `ceasta-cli` is built)
```
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j      # build/ceasta.app and build/ceasta-cli
```
ci builds glfw and ceasta for arm64 and x86_64 at once (`-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"`) and packs the dmg, see `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

## code

- `src/app.*` — state, actions and the main layout; `src/app_mcp.cpp` runs the AI server from the app
- `src/ui/` — one file per panel (top_bar, left_panel, ida_view, graph_view, pseudo_view, right_panel, cpu_panel, bottom_panel, status_bar, dialogs)
- `src/widgets/` — small shared bits (nav_band, splitter)
- `src/core/` — no ui: loaders (`binary`, `pe`, `elf`, `macho`), `fileinfo`, `disasm` (capstone), `analysis`, `database`, `search`, `decompiler`, `protos` (known api prototypes), `lua_host`, `debugger` (win32) + `debugger_linux` (ptrace) + `dbg_stack` (call stacks), `mcp` + `mcp_transport` (the AI server), `diff`, `signatures`, `exchange` (ida / ghidra / x64dbg), `os`
- `src/cli/` — ceasta-cli and the `dbg` terminal debugger
- `plugins/` — lua plugins that ship with it
- `scripts/` — `ida_to_ceasta.py` and `ghidra_to_ceasta.py`: your names from those tools, for file > import names
- `docs/` — the [lua guide](docs/lua.md), the [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md), third-party licenses, screenshots
- `installer/` — inno setup script and packaging; `packaging/linux/` — the AppImage's desktop entry and icon; `packaging/macos/` — the app's Info.plist and icon; `src/mac_platform.mm` — the mac open / save panels
- `third_party/` — imgui, capstone (x86, arm64 and mips), lua 5.4
